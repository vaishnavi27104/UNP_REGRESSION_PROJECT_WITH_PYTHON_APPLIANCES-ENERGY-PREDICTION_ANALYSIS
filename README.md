# UNP_REGRESSION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_APPLIANCES-ENERGY-PREDICTION_ANALYSIS

This project was completed as part of my internship with UNP Education and focuses on predicting household appliances energy consumption using machine learning techniques in Python. The dataset was thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, followed by an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships among variables affecting energy usage. Various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor were implemented and compared based on performance metrics like RÂ² score, MAE, and RMSE. The project aims to understand the key factors influencing energy consumption and build an efficient predictive model that can help in optimizing household energy management.
